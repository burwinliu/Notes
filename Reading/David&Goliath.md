# David & Goliath
* Goliath was traditionally stronger -- with large stature, muscles, etc. Should've beat David in straight up 1v1 in traditional battle of spear/sword -- in traditional sense he was better equipped. With untraditional tactics + disadvantages that Goliath has (blindness with his stature?), David defeats him with rocks and slings, beating him at range before he can approach
* Lesson: Use untraditional approach and the weaknesses of your opposition to create victory
# Basketball
* With great conditioning, outrun and defeat the opposition with technically better skill 
# Class Size
* Inverted U curve -- extremely large and extremely small is bad
* Without opposition, it becomes difficult to innovate and adapt to new situations -- and therefore very affluent childrens sometimes fail to have the same inventiveness as their less affluential background parents
# University
* Being where you can excel is often good morally and for success -- without it, if you are in a tough enviornment, but in a lower standard, you suffer and fail to acttuate full potential
# Dyslexia
* Having some level of struggle with life promotes careful thinking and more innovations to overcome adveristy -- or terrible failure in life (more extreme outcome in terms of success)
# Doctors
* In bad upbringing, they may have "direct" trauma that inhibits them, or "remote" trauma that emboldens and pushes people foreward (think Blitz, people being out of house w/o fear)
    * Gives people courage to innovate (disagreeable) and innovate out of necessity (more organized and more innovative) to survive circumstances, and thrive in the world
    * Lukemia treatment that was seen as inhumane/too risky given (extra platelettes, extra strong chemo)
# Civil Rights
* Moral legitimacy aside, with the help of trickery, born out of necessity, annd a malicious opponent (predictable?) you can manipulate a situation to overcome odds
    * One picture to turn public perception, even if it was not representative of that situation, can create empathy and move movements forewards
# The Troubles
* Delegitimate authority can cause more trouble then help, and strict crackdown causes many more issues -- therefore first establish legitemacy before acting
    * Troubles: British army, being a "protestant" figure, were seen as delegitimate
    * Classroom Teachers: Seen as unhelpful and not interesting cause a meltdown in a class
    * Cops: Seen as enemies that threw families to jail, would not be able to crackdown on crime (therefore provide "friendliness" and show of legitemacy to create rapport)
# Murders
* Triple strike was born out of good inetntions, but ineffective and undue burden on state
* Troubles has similar situation -- very strict enforcement that led to anger towards authority
* Candace murdered, and with her murder, tried to find peace -- resulted in a story of healing
* The story advocates for careful approach to grief? And to not overly use punishment or authority to enact will without analyzing things very carefully
# Dissidents
* Even in WW2 Vichy France, people still dared to oppose the rule w/ community to not house fleeing Jewish people -- due to history of dissidents and lack of fear of the punishment that may come + the experience to survive + the cost to try and punish such a community being too high
    * Opposition and morals can create the fiercist of dissidents, to even overcome terrifying situations, esp with experiences with similary terrors
# Vietnam
* With overwhelming force the US *should* win, but with an understanding of the people and the "backed into a corner" mentality, they would never lose either

# Thoughts
The book presents a lot of annecdotal based information, and a lot of the data *feels* custom fit for his arguements -- but I can never be sure. The values and the points seem logical enough; however great advantages are great for a reason -- and therefore, I am skeptical of the points at times. Overall, do keep in mind the potential upset that underdogs may provide
